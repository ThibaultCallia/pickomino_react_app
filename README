# Planetary Pirates Project

Hello, welcome to Planetary Pirates.

My name is Thibault Calliauw and I am the creator of this web app.

### Rights

It’s important to note that I did not create the game nor do I own any rights. This game is based on “Regenwormen” by 999 Games. This is merely a student project and not to be used for any commercial ends.

### About me and the project

In September 2022, I quit my job and started a Full Stack Development course. This is my first full stack project.

The libraries used in this project are:

-   Frontend: React, Redux, ChakraUI, Typescript and Socket client
-   Backend: NodeJS, Express and Socket.io
